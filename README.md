My dataset is on City of Seattle Staff Demographics. The data was created February 25, 2019 and is provided by the Seattle Department of Human Resources. It is updated on a monthly basis, with its most recent update being January 31, 2023. The dataset contains 13387 observations and 7 variables.

My plot displays the number of employees per City of Seattle Department by race. I have two checkbox inputs that allow the user to select which departments and which races they would like to view. The user can also select whether to view the plot as a stacked or side-by-side(dodge) bar plot. 

My table displays the percentage of white vs. non-white employees per City of Seattle Department. I have one checkbox input that allows the user to select which departments they would like to view.
